# Paleo superstatistics 

*Super statistical analysis of the marine Phanerozoic fossil record* 

Using two seminal fossil datasets we show that fluctuations in marine biodiversity over the past 550 million years results from the superposition of many independently fluctuating subsystems whose fluctuations are Gaussian but give rise to non-Gaussian patterns when combined. This process is akin to the same non-equilibrium theory known as superstatistics that has been applied to previously hard-to-explain patterns in economics and physical systems. In the fossil record, these independent subsystems correspond to lineages of closely related animal taxa, implying that diversification within lineages is driven by random additive interactions with the environment. Our findings thus challenge the idea that changes in origination and extinction through deep geologic time are the result of complicated evolutionary interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment. However, we demonstrate that the evolutionary process responsible for generating new lineages varies slowly through time, possibly driven by non-random evolutionary innovations in the physiology and demography of new lineages. This slow change between lineages produces patterns of apparent complexity earlier ascribed to unnecessarily complicated mechanisms. We further show, using permutational null models, that our findings are not an artifact of how fossils are taxonomically classified but rather capture true underlying biological processes.
