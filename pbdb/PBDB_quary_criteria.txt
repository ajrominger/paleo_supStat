inclusion criteria (from Alroy 2008 Science):
(1) excluded collections known to come from poorly lithified sediments that were sieved or from entirely unlithified sediments
(2) Collections from non-marine settings were excluded. 
(3) Collections of the coarsest spatial scale (basin) or stratigraphic scale (geological group) were excluded. 
(4) Multiple occurrences of the same genus in a single collection were treated as a single occurrence. 
(5) Reidentifications of individual occurrences and blanket synonymies were both employed. 
(6) To ensure comparability with earlier analyses (e.g., S2, S3), subgenera were treated as separate genera. 
(7) Genera whose names were qualified with the term "aff." or with quotation marks were excluded. 
(8) Form taxa and ichnofossils were excluded, leaving only body fossils
(9) all other PBDB defaults
