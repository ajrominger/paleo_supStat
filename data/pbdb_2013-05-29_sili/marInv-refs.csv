It should be noted, however, that there are numerous problems in that paper with regard to age assignment of the succession and to exposed intervals.For instance, no Albian faunas were recorded and Campanian deposits were misdated as Maastrichtian, Turonian as Coniacian, Santonian as Campanian, Danian as Maastrichtian, etc. Later, MATSUMOTO (1959c) noted that, at first glance, the zones proposed by SHIMIZU appeared to compare well to those then known in Europe, but in fact they often conflicted with data  obtained during subsequent field work."",1%,22320,"2006-09-10 11:28:48","2006-09-13 03:21:17"
