META DATA FOR SEPKOSKI SUPER STAT SCRIPTS

/Users/andrewrominger/Desktop/Fulbright/paleo_superStat/sepk_obCreate.R
sepk_obCreate.R creates objects summarizing diversity and fluctuation for all Sepkoski data. here is where decisions are made about which groups to include, and which to exclude. also, here is where the details of how fluctuation are calculated, specifically, whether or not to assume flux_t = div_t - div_{t-1} OR flux_t = div_{t+1} - div_t. Using the first (t - {t-1}) allows more strait-forward simulation in sepk_superstat_tsum.R

/Users/andrewrominger/Desktop/Fulbright/paleo_superStat/sepk_supstat.R
sepk_supstat.R creates all super stat objects (most importantly for orders, but also for other taxonomic levels). it depends on sepk_obCreate.R to create objects containing diversity and fluctuation data for orders and other taxonomic levels

/Users/andrewrominger/Desktop/Fulbright/paleo_superStat/sepk_superstat_tsum.R
sepk_superstat_tsum.R creates functions to be used in simulating distribution of fluctuations after summing orders by time bin. it also completes this simulation and makes some summary plots, including 95% confidence envelope on the cumulative density and on the tail exponent.

/Users/andrewrominger/Desktop/Fulbright/paleo_superStat/sepk_ord_perm.R
sepk_ord_perm.R permutes the order classification of different genera and for each calculates the distance between the observed and ``simulated'' D-statistic (distance between CDF) of data and theory.
