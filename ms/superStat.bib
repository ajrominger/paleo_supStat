  Abstract =	 {It has previously been thought that there was a
                  steep Cretaceous and Cenozoic radiation of marine
                  invertebrates. This pattern can be replicated with a
                  new data set of fossil occurrences representing 3.5
                  million specimens, but only when older analytical
                  protocols are used. Moreover, analyses that employ
                  sampling standardization and more robust counting
                  methods show a modest rise in diversity with no
                  clear trend after the mid-Cretaceous. Globally,
                  locally, and at both high and low latitudes,
                  diversity was less than twice as high in the Neogene
                  as in the mid-Paleozoic. The ratio of global to
                  local richness has changed little, and a latitudinal
                  diversity gradient was present in the early
                  Paleozoic.},

  Abstract =	 {The fossil record demonstrates that each major
                  taxonomic group has a consistent net rate of
                  diversification and a limit to its species
                  richness. It has been thought that long-term changes
                  in the dominance of major taxonomic groups can be
                  predicted from these characteristics. However, new
                  analyses show that diversity limits may rise or fall
                  in response to adaptive radiations or
                  extinctions. These changes are idiosyncratic and
                  occur at different times in each taxa. For example,
                  the end-Permian mass extinction permanently reduced
                  the diversity of important, previously dominant
                  groups such as brachiopods and crinoids. The current
                  global crisis may therefore permanently alter the
                  biosphere's taxonomic composition by changing the
                  rules of evolution.},

                  descriptions. Tsallis statistics follows from a

  Abstract =	 { <p>Many studies assume stock prices follow a random
                  process known as geometric Brownian motion. Although
                  approximately correct, this model fails to explain
                  the frequent occurrence of extreme price movements,
                  such as stock market crashes. Using a large
                  collection of data from three different stock
                  markets, we present evidence that a modification to
                  the random model---adding a slow, but significant,
                  fluctuation to the standard deviation of the
                  process---accurately explains the probability of
                  different-sized price changes, including the
                  relative high frequency of extreme
                  movements. Furthermore, we show that this process is
                  similar across stocks so that their price
                  fluctuations can be characterized by a single
                  curve. Because the behavior of price fluctuations is
                  rooted in the characteristics of volatility, we
                  expect our results to bring increased interest to
                  stochastic volatility models, and especially to
                  those that can produce the properties of volatility

                  diversity covaries with the amount of marine
                  sedimentary rock. The extent to which this
                  covariation reflects a geologically controlled
                  sampling bias remains unknown. We show that
                  Phanerozoic records of seawater chemistry and
                  continental flooding contain information on the
                  diversity of marine animals that is independent of
                  sedimentary rock quantity and
                  sampling. Interrelationships among variables suggest
                  long-term interactions among continental flooding,
                  sulfur and carbon cycling, and macroevolution. Thus,
                  mutual responses to interacting Earth systems, not

                  bioturbation, are thought to be fundamental
                  determinants of macroevolutionary trends. A data set
                  containing global occurrences of Phanerozoic fossils
                  of benthic marine invertebrates shows escalatory
                  trends in the relative frequency of ecological

                  infaunal or mobile organisms. Associations between
                  these trends are either statistically insignificant
                  or interpretable as preservational effects. Thus,
                  there is no evidence that escalation drives
                  macroecological trends at global and million-year

                  species evolve in bursts or `avalanches', during
                  which they become on average more susceptible to
                  environmental stresses such as harsh climates and so
                  are more easily rendered extinct. Results of
                  simulations and analytic calculations using our
                  model show a powerlaw distribution of extinction
                  sizes which is in reasonable agreement with fossil
                  data. We also see several features qualitatively
                  similar to those seen in the fossil record. For
                  example, we see frequent smaller extinctions in the
                  wake of a large mass extinction which arise because
                  there is reduced competition for resources in the
                  aftermath of a large extinction event, so species
                  which would not normally be able to compete can get
                  a foothold, but only until the next cold winter or
                  bad attack of influenza comes along to wipe them

  Annote =	 {A simple equilibrial model for the growth and
                  maintenance of Phanerozoic global marine taxonomic
                  diversity can be constructed from considerations of
                  the behavior of origination and extinction rates
                  with respect to diversity. An initial postulate that
                  total rate of diversification is proportional to
                  number of taxa extant leads to an exponential model
                  for early phases of diversification. This model
                  appears to describe adequately the "explosive"
                  diversification of known metazoan orders across the
                  Precambrian-Cambrian Boundary, suggesting that no
                  special event, other than the initial appearance of
                  Metazoa, is necessary to explain this phenomenon. As
                  numbers of taxa increase, the rate of
                  diversification should become "diversity dependent."
                  Ecological factors should cause the per taxon rate
                  of origination to decline and the per taxon rate of
                  extinction to increase. If these relationships are
                  modeled as simple linear functions, a logistic
                  description of the behavior of taxonomic diversity
                  through time results. This model appears remarkably
                  consistent with the known pattern of Phanerozoic
                  marine ordinal diversity as a whole. Analysis of
                  observed rates of ordinal origination also indicates
                  these are to a large extent diversity dependent;
                  however, diversity dependence is not immediately
                  evident in rates of ordinal extinction. Possible
                  explanations for this pattern are derived from
                  considerations of the size of higher taxa and from
                  simulations of their diversification. These suggest
                  that both the standing diversity and the pattern of
                  origination of orders may adequately reflect the
                  behavior of species diversity through time; however,
                  correspondence between rates of ordinal and species
                  extinction may deteriorate with progressive loss of
                  information resulting from incomplete sampling of

                  perturbations is used to describe large-scale
                  patterns in the diversification of Phanerozoic
                  marine families. The basic model assumes that the
                  Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern evolutionary faunas
                  each diversified logistically as a consequence of
                  early exponential growth and of later slowing of
                  growth as the ecosystems became filled; it also
                  assumes interaction among the evolutionary faunas
                  such that expansion of the combined diversities of
                  all three faunas above any single fauna's
                  equilibrium caused that fauna's diversity to begin
                  to decline. This basic model adequately describes
                  the diversification of the evolutionary faunas
                  through the Paleozoic Era as well as the
                  asymmetrical rise and fall of background extinction
                  rates through the entire Phanerozoic. Declines in
                  diversity and changes in faunal dominance associated
                  with mass extinctions can be accommodated in the
                  model with short-term accelerations in extinction
                  rates or declines in equilibria. Such accelerations,
                  or perturbations, cause diversity to decline
                  exponentially and then to rebound sigmoidally
                  following release. The amount of decline is
                  dependent on the magnitude and duration of the
                  perturbation, the timing of the perturbation with
                  respect to the diversification of the system, and
                  the system's initial per-taxon rates of
                  diversification and turnover. When applied to the
                  three-phase model, such perturbations describe the
                  changes in diversity and faunal dominance during and
                  after major mass extinctions, the long-term rise in
                  total diversity following the Late Permian and
                  Norian mass extinctions, and the peculiar
                  diversification and then decline of the remnants of
                  the Paleozoic fauna during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic
                  Eras. The good fit of this model to data on
                  Phanerozoic familial diversity suggests that many of
                  the large-scale patterns of diversification seen in
                  the marine fossil record of animal families are
                  simple consequences of nonlinear interrelationships
                  among a small number of parameters that are
                  intrinsic to the evolutionary faunas and are largely
