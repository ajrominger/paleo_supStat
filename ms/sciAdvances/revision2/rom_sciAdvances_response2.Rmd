We are grateful to the reviewers and Prof. Aaron Clauset for helping to substantially improve our manuscript.  Below we detail our responses to each comment and in the manuscript text our new edits are highlighted in blue.

## Reviewer 1

I thank the authors for taking on board my comments. In particular it helped that the authors clarified the relationship between beta and niche structure, so that (IIUC) the parameter beta should be interpreted just as one among multiple other traits that may plausibly be similar for organisms within the same taxonomic group.

My remaining remarks relate to the model assumptions and I am going to reiterate one of my earlier comments that I hope the authors can address or comment on.

** there is still some ambiguity on whether I should think of there as being net diversification or not. The authors say in their supplementary information that “most fossil occurrences of a taxon come from the period of its history when it is dominant and in steady state. In a time slice of duration τ during such a period of steady state the latent per capita rates of origination and extinction would be equal (i.e. λ = μ ≡ #)”.

This seems at odds with the need (stated more clearly elsewhere) to zero-center the time series of species richness, thus in effect removing the effects of net diversification (i.e. removing any net increasing or decreasing richness within a taxonomic group).

The authors also say that

``We also note that the distributions of fluctuations for most clades are already very close to a mean of 0’’

So perhaps this small difference is why this doesn’t seem like a big deal either way— but I’d like to see it stated more clearly in the model description whether they authors are in effect considering a model with net lambda-mu non-zero, fitting this model, and then focusing on lambda+mu (the variance)—or if this is not the right way to think about their approach.

** The model described in S1 with net (per taxon) diversification rate lambda-mu =0 is in effect a model analogous to pure drift—correct? To derive the expected form of Gaussian fluctuations around the mean taxon abundance the authors state that

``Under the steady state assumption we can approximate N(t) by mean(N)’’

On short timescales it would be reasonable to treat the number of taxa in a higher taxonomic group, N, as equal to its mean value, and hence I’d expect the authors’ stated result. However, if the baseline of the time series relative to 1/lambda is large, then I would expect to see large excursions away from the mean value under this pure drift model. I think it would be helpful to clarify whether this is a self-consistent assumption given the parameter values the authors find.

** Related to this—the authors use the terminology `steady-state’. But there is no steady- state in the linear birth-death model (apart from the absorbing state when a family or order disappears altogether). So this terminology should be clarified. Or if I am missing what is meant by this, maybe the steady-state in this model could be defined.

** In the birth-death model I was not quite sure what would be the “null” dependence
of beta on family size, N—i.e. how would beta depend on family size if lambda and mu were identical for all families. I had thought that beta might be proportional to (or at least increasing with) N, which was somewhat born out by the three families shown in Fig 1A and C. I.e. the smaller mean richness in the Spondylidae goes with the smallest fitted value of beta. Etc.

However, Fig S6 shows the opposite relationship altogether—roughly this figure shows that beta~1/N, and this seems worthy of more comment! In fact, I can’t even quite see where the Spondylidae family can fit into fig S6, given that they have a (standardized) mean richness of 1 genus and fitted beta ~ 10^{-1}. But maybe this is just down to the way the y-axis is defined in Fig S6 vs Fig 1A.

In any case, this is an interesting relationship that seems like it has some power in explaining the variability in fitted values of beta across families. However, the authors say it is not sufficient to explain the observed variation in betas. I did not quite understand
how the permutation test described in the main text was showing this. But maybe here is another way of thinking about it. Suppose I fitted beta ~ const/N using Fig S6. How much worse would this do than the gamma distribution that is fitted to observed betas in Fig 1C?

In summary I think Fig S6 deserves more comment and readers may want to understand better why we would see beta ~ 1/N.

** Overall, one suggestion that might clarify some of the above questions might be to infer the best fit parameters for the birth-death process from the observed transitions for each time series, allowing both lambda and mu to be fitted parameters, and then these more clearly related to beta.


## Reviewer 2

The authors have responded to comments in my original review by (1) adding an analysis of families, (2) revising parts that argue for the utility of the superstatistics approach, and (3) revising some of the process interpretations based on the results. I appreciate the family analysis, which is similar to that of orders in showing macroevolutionary coherence within taxonomic units.

As for changes (2), I feel pretty similarly as I did about the first version of the manuscript. The methods are interesting and, as far as I can tell, valid. I am still not sure that have clear advantages over other approaches, but I could be wrong, and it would be good to release these ideas into the wild, so to speak, and see how they fare.

In terms of interpretation, the revisions are fine, though I think the same limitation holds in that the main result — macroevolutionary dynamics are more within clades rather than between clades — is not very surprising. But there may be value in the specifics of how this work breaks down this heterogeneity.

One side note about interpretation: the paper uses the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to frame the interpretations, but in places I lost the thread of this framing. The adaptive landscape in macroevolution is usually used in the interpretation of trait evolution, not speciation/extinction dynamics. I think the connection made here is the assumption that the clade volatilities (beta_k) are related to trait values, which may evolve by OU-like dynamics on an adaptive landscape. Does there need to be an additional assumption about the nature of this relationship - linear, perhaps?

I was tripped up in interpreting this quote: “For macroevolutionary rates to vary across an adaptive landscape, this landscape cannot be flat, and thus niche conservatism around local optima in adaptive space interrupted by adaptive exploration is likely (27,47)."

What does elevation on this landscape represent? For OU dynamics, a flat landscape indicates Brownian motion. Brownian motion still produces trait variation, and If trait variation causes differences in clade volatilities (beta_k), then Brownian motion will still produce variation in macroevolutionary rates. So I am confused as to how the adaptive landscape is construed in this interpretation.
